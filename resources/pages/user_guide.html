					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section provides detailed, step-by-step operation instructions for the system but does not describe the use of the functions contained within the system.</p>

					<h5 id="guide-4-1" class="text-center"><u>4.1 - Initiate Operation</u></h5>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This application can be downloaded and installed through the default application marketplace on the user’s device.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section contains procedures for system log-in and initialization to a common known point, such as a system main menu screen.  This initialization procedure should describe how to establish necessary modes of operation and set any initial parameters required for operation. Software installation procedures are to be included if the software is distributed on diskette and should be downloaded before each use.</p>

					<h5 id="guide-4-2" class="text-center"><u>4.2 - Maintain Operation</u></h5>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application will require constant network connection in order to perform automatic updates, authentication, and connection with surrounding gamers. These updates can be expected to have no more than a month between each other. </p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an error occurs during the update process, attempt to reload the page or run the application updater on a desktop PC.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If on a mobile device, reinstall the application or wait for another update as one may be available once issues have been found in order to remedy any issues found in common systems.</p>

					<h5 id="guide-4-3" class="text-center"><u>4.3 - Terminate and Restart Operations</u></h5>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If improper termination or stalling of the application has occurred, there are some ways the user can attempt to regain control or force restart the system.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If using our desktop application, the user can type:</p>
					<p><blockquote>UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A, ENTER</blockquote></p>
					<p>This will allow the application to attempt to automatically find a resolution to the problem.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If on a mobile device, the user should restart the entire machine by using the manufacturer defined key sequence.</p>

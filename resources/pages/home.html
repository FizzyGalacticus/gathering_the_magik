	<h1>Come here,</h1>

	<p>Gather 'round and listen to the story yet to unfold. 
	A story of adventurers both brave and bold.
	Set forth on a journey of mystery untold
	To find the great treasure of which only legend had told.
	This is your story, if you choose it to be so,
	For as many before you have come to know
	That this journey can be filled with misery and woe,
	But fear not and do not go.</p>

	<p>This is why I am here,
	And this is why you must listen,
	For the companions you need can be easily found.
	Thirsty for adventure they come from all around.
	Seeking their next adventure, seeking a new quest,
	Always hungry to know what is next.</p>

	<p>I can help you gather them here,
	As they will be eager to listen
	To the adventure you have planned to go.
	For in this is no misery or woe,
	And soon you will come to know
	Each other and the adventure will only grow.</p>

	<p>It will be your legends to be told.
	Legends of you, the brave and bold.
	So when the next story begins to unfold,</p>

	<p>Gather we will here,
	For here we all will listen,
	Because here is where you</p>

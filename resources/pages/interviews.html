			<p>Our interview volunteers quickly grasped our purpose for the creation of the app. After moving through some of the basic uses of it, they moved to more fringe uses and possibly divergent ones. There was consideration about how, if they (as users) were going to actually use the application, it needs to be quick. If someone wants to play a game, they will not be interested in a terrible interface to get to it. One piece that needs to work smoothly is the means of communicating with other users.</p>

			<p>It was decided unanimously by our interviewees that the user interface needs to be simple, elegant, and intuitive. The real-estate of the screen should be used efficiently and effectively, and without a design that is obnoxious and takes away from the experience. If there are huge and bulky images or buttons that aren’t necessary to the specific task at hand, they need to go.</p> 

			<p>Also, many interviewees seemed interested in search options. If they want something specifically, or if they are just more generally browsing. Our search options really need to be fleshed out. This is especially so, as this will keep the program more current over time as new games come out, and will allow our users to really focus on what they like.</p>

			<p>Another important aspect brought up in our questions was a user’s privacy. Inherently, by using the program, there is a possibility for a loss of privacy. Certain games may require a user's location to know which are joinable.</p>

			<p>There are also thoughts on having the application have access to some sort of calendar program. This could then act as a reminder to commitments a particular user made for games, and serve as a means of long-term communication between users. This would allow users to plan for multiple appointments to be made without users failing to meet prior engagements.</p>

			<p>It was also of popular opinion that a user profile should be able to have the standard setting of public, friends, and private. However, users should be able to interact with other profiles in the form of rating a user’s ability of playing well with others. Using this process, a user can gain a reputation for their style of gameplay, acquiring (or losing) credibility. The user profile should also store statistics to be able to suggest other games of the same or similar type in a user’s area.</p>

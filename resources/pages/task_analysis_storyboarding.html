				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approaching the storyboarding process, we envisioned some of the possible activities users would seek to accomplish when given the Gathering the Magik application. We quickly broke down each action based off of varying levels of difficulty and necessity to the overall use of the program. This storyboard is more likely to represent the normal user experience rather than one going into a lot of the detailed options we support.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing we felt it would be appropriate to work out was the process of signing up. This a process that so many people have completed already, and we want our signup process to be similar in order to avoid any surprises. The initial step would be for the user to access the site or download the application.  Next, they would choose a prominent button that would run you through a set of prompts necessary for account creation. This will include basic information such as email, user name, and a captcha verification. This simple email verification will be helpful for users contacting one another in the future as well as for account recovery. Gathering the Magik would like to have some more expensive options such as gps for game location and player matching, but this should be a togglable option for the user. Upon account creation, there will need to be a “remember me” option for the client, as people rarely want to sign in every time they open an application.</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our second storyboard, we addressed joining and hosting games. The most important thing we noted was, since this is most likely different than many applications the user has used, there would need to be a tutorial offered upon initial launch. As told numerous times by our interviewees, this needs to remain accessible to the user in case new features are added, or the client needs a refresher. Following this, the user shall have a section where they can enter interests in order for the application to make suggestions for games for them to join. They should then be able to select between joining an existing game, or hosting their own. This will allow the user to have different options. When searching for what games to play, it should give them a distance  required for travel, and an occupancy level. Of course, it should also list the game and genre itself. If the user chooses to enable location or GPS sharing, the application will be able to find matches for the user without the user actively being within the application. This feature would be based off of proximity to other users.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final task that we made as a storyboard was communicating with other users. Since the user is required to use an email address to sign up for the application, they could use it as a communication medium within the app. We also would like for our users to use their cell phone to receive text messages from other users. These services should remain anonymous, similar to that of Craigslist’s email function. There are also plans to implement in app messaging, but we understand that many people would not find this to be their preferred method of communication. The functionality of it should include multiple conversations and group conversations. This, however, should be silenceable if they use another messenger as their default, in order to avoid getting the same message multiple times.</p>

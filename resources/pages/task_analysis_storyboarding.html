				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approaching the storyboarding process, we envisioned some of the possible activities users would seek to accomplish when given the Gathering the Magik&trade; application. We quickly broke down each action based on the varying levels of difficulty and necessity for the overall use of the program. This storyboard is more likely to represent what the normal user would experience rather than one going into every detailed option we support.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first action we felt would be appropriate to work out was the signup process. Because this process has been completed so many times before with other applications, we wanted our process to be similar in order to avoid any surprises. The initial step would be for the user to access the site or download the application.  When the application is used for the first time, there will be a prominent button the user is allowed to select that will run them through a set of prompts necessary for account creation. These prompts will include giving basic information such as an email, username, and password, all of which is then followed by captcha verification. The user will then be sent a simple verification message to their preferred email. Once verified, the user can use their preferred email for various actions such as receiving message alerts from other users or using account recovery options. Gathering the Magik&trade; would like to have some more premium options such as GPS for game location and player matching but such an option should be allowed to switch on and off by the user. Upon account creation, there will need to be a &ldquo;remember me&rdquo; option for the client, as people rarely want to sign in every time they open an application.</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our second storyboard, we addressed some of the key features that should be included based off of our interviewees’ reactions to our questions. The most sought after feature, we noted, was that users may need to be offered a tutorial upon initial launch. This is due to the possibility of the application being much different compared to others the user has previously used. As told numerous times by our interviewees, this feature will need to remain accessible to the user in the case of new features being added, or the user needs a refresher.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very important feature, suggested through our inquiries, was allowing the user to enter their interests and letting the application make suggestions or recommendations for new games to join. They should then be able to select between joining an existing game, or hosting their own. This will allow the user to have different options. When searching for what games to play, it should give them the game title and genre. Of course, it should also list a distance required for travel and an occupancy level. If the user chooses to enable location or GPS sharing, the application will be able to find matches for the user without the user actively being within the application. This feature would be based off of proximity to other users.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final task that we made as a storyboard were the options of communication between users. Since the user is required to use an email address to sign up for the application, they could use it as a communication medium within the app. We also would like for our users to use their cell phone to receive text messages from other users. These services should remain anonymous similar to that of Craigslist’s email function. There are also plans to implement in app messaging but we understand that many people would not find this to be their preferred method of communication. This is due in part to other applications made for communication that can provide a more robust set of functionality. The full functionality we would like to implement should allow the user to hold multiple conversations at once, either with another individual user or with a group of many users. This, however, should be silenceable if they use another messenger as their default, in order to avoid getting the same message multiple times.</p>

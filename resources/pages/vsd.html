			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We introduce a set of four criteria – stakeholders, time, values, and pervasiveness – intended to provide perspective and focus for considering the long-term systemic effects of current and future technologies. The time and pervasiveness criteria provide a future-oriented perspective. The stakeholders and values criteria focus on ethical considerations. Used in combination, we posit that the criteria go a good distance toward articulating what a value sensitive envisioning process might entail when considering functionality requirements, compatibility issues, and contexts of use in terms of systemic effects on persons and society.

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Envision your system in use by a single stakeholder. Now imagine 100 such individuals interacting with the system. Then 1,000 individuals. Then 100,000. What new interactions might emerge from widespread use? Find three synergistic benefits of widespread use and three potential breakdowns.&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this particular issue, we looked at a similar situation, Facebook, where this might be the case. Facebook was created originally as a forum-type website solely for Harvard University students. Now, it is used by over 1.5 billion people worldwide (Expandedramblings). We believe that our application, although being made solely to target a specific group of people, might contain functionality that others would be interested in using as a type of social media. Features like having profiles, friends, being matched with others according to personal preferences, and so forth are all things that you see on Facebook today. With this in mind, the possibility exists that, after a while, the underlying infrastructure and security of our application would need to be expanded to accommodate the public demand.</p> <!-- PERVASIVENESS -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Enumerate 2-3 diverse geographies.  For each geographic setting, consider ways in which the system could be adapted to better fit that environment.&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that had not quite come to our thoughts until it was brought up. With our application relying on the community to work together to meet up and play games, this could make it difficult for small and spread out groups of people to really benefit from the program. Since Gathering the Magik can be used on all sorts of events, they could choose to meet online, or perhaps for some outdoor activity. There also could be locations set up between towns, or local shops, that deal in games  or reserve space for activities. </p> <!-- PERVASIVENESS -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Characterize two different political environments in which your system is likely to be deployed.  Consider how those political realities may influence how individuals in those environments may interact with the features of your system.&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was one of the most difficult cards to answer. At first, our group was very confused about what the card was asking. Then we began to think about other countries in which certain or specific social gatherings were regulated or not even permitted. We believe that humans as a whole share a fondness for games in general, without any specifics. This means that our application could potentially disrupt current government or political policies currently suppressing game players around the world. An example would be North Korea, where social media, Internet, etc. are all regulated and censored. If our application were to become popular enough, it might cause some disturbance in their current governmental system.</p> <!-- PERVASIVENESS -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Record 2-3 positive effects of your technology when used within your own cultural context.  How might those effects be different in another culture?  Develop and discuss potential breakdowns.&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How different cultures might be affected by our application is an important aspect to consider. Social benefits could arise from the development of the app, such as in-person multicultural meetings and giving people the chance to meet up in a venue with people of different cultures. Gathering the Magik&trade; is giving people the chance to step outside of their social bounds and into a new, fun, and possibly educational way. As a society, we generally agree that having these interactions could greatly strengthen and enrich our culture. </p> <!-- PERVASIVENESS -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Identify three roles that involve non-intended use of the system.&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our initial thoughts after reading this moved to how many other possible types of events it could pull people together for. However, after a minute, we realized there was another side we have to really consider especially when the card asks for unintended uses. First, we considered some things such as  political rallies, a meeting of people, but not to play games or do fun activities. The next thought was how advertisements could be thrown up there; there may be ads with the service but not fake games to serve as advertisements for free. Finally, the worst case is that this acts as an easier way to set up abductions. Since the app works to facilitate people meeting up, even though they do not know each other there, this is where that danger arises.</p> <!-- STAKEHOLDERS -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Generate a list of 3-5 indirect stakeholders. For each indirect stakeholder role, note at least one concern specific to that role. You may refer back to these roles throughout the project.&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This card made us think about some issues that were not straight-forward or apparent. The largest indirect stakeholder in our opinion are the parents of minors using our application. The biggest concern here is that our application could potentially be used by a predator for illegal activities. The second indirect stakeholder we listed was local business. We are concerned that our application could potentially cause an influx in loitering within the premises of local business, potentially disturbing their everyday business. Finally, we listed game makers/developers as an indirect stakeholder. Our application could be a means to either make or break a particular game and can even raise or lower the demand for those games.</p> <!-- STAKEHOLDERS -->

						<hr>

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Create a list of the system's direct stakeholders.  For each stakeholder role, note at least one concern specific to that role.  You may refer back to these roles throughout the project.&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made us take time to consider who is interested in the success of our business. Each stakeholder may have a concern that stems from the development of the product, such as small specialty shops worrying about what they need to stock. Event and public meeting areas may have an influx in use, which would require more maintenance and upkeep. Finally, game manufacturers are going to possibly see a change in their business, for better or worse. They may even display opposition toward our application.</p> <!-- STAKEHOLDERS -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Design a scenario of your product changing hands.  Imagine a specific challenge an individual might face when wanting to shift ownership.  What features might make this process smoother?&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brought up a scenario that we had not previously considered, since the idea would only be important in specific instances. The best example we came up with would be if some event needed to change hands from one user to another. This situation could arise if the current owner of the event or game felt that another user would do a better job managing the event and wants to pass ownership.</p> <!-- STAKEHOLDERS -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Invent a future storyline in which the system you are developing is no longer supported.  Consider how obsolescence affects normal use of the system, and how problems with the system may be resolved.&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made us seriously consider evaluating the possibilities of our application losing the support of our communities. Because it is a simple idea as long as the program itself fails to be ported to newer technologies, it realies solely on the involvement of the user since they are interacting with each other, and this simply acts as a facilitator between them.</p> <!-- TIME -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Imagine five years out from now and consider 3-5 ways the system might influence friendships and family relationships.&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We thought about the possible effects of our application on stakeholders, and there were a few things that stood out. The most common, almost stereotypical, thought about any game or gamer is the addictive properties. We want to provide our users with the best experience possible and to maintain credibility while doing so. Game addiction is certainly not unheard of, and is definitely one of our primary concerns. Another, brighter prospect we considered is of our application bringing people together and potentially laying the foundation for new friendships and even families. We acknowledge that some of our users may not be the most socially aware, and we hope to close the gap with our application.</p> <!-- TIME -->

						<hr>

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Picture your system in use many years from now.  Identify three ways in which an individual's intentional non-use of the system might affect that person's daily life or the system as a whole.&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the possibility of people not using our application was not particularly difficult. It should not become a very prolific thing in people's lives. It will help them arrange games between themselves and others, however there will still be ways for people to communicate outside the application. The goal is not to phase out other means of people communicating, so at worst the intentional non-use of the system would cause a person to have additional difficulties finding members of their game community to play with.</p> <!-- TIME -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Visualize one lifestyle change that could be supported by your technology.  Consider whether your technology would inhibit any positive lifestyle changes.&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest problem that we’re trying to solve with Gathering the Magik&trade; is loneliness. Far too many times have we, and others, felt isolated from a good time. This is due to a gap in the market for applications just like ours. There are plenty of people just like us that would love to find and meet new people that are equally interested in bonding over games. Our top goal is to get people out of the basement and into the game!</p> <!-- TIME -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Deliberate on and then designate three primary values the system ideally would support.&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering what sort of values might be cultivated by being a user of our application allows us to see some of the possible benefits. Gathering the Magik as a system tries to promote personal interaction, diversity, and healthy competition. People get together to play games in a day and age where digital interaction is growing in popularity. The diversity comes through the exploration of new games and meeting new people to interact with. Finally, a healthy competitive atmosphere is important. We want people to be invested in their games while not getting worked up about it, that way it stays an enjoyable experience for a variety of people.</p> <!-- VALUES -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Ask potential users whether use of the system has any positive or negative effects on a value that they feel is important.  You might ask whether a specific feature of the system is OK and why (e.g., A camera is pointed at a fountain in a public plaza.  The live images of people in the plaza are being displayed in someone's office.  Is it OK or not OK that the image is displayed in the office if the people in the plaza are unaware of it?  Why or why not?).&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This card was met with very positive feedback. Our group decided unanimously that our application’s sole purpose is to bring people with common gaming interests together. Therefore, any issues between users could be avoided simply by not joining games with known problematic users. Should any issues escalate further, then we would handle those on a case by case basis, but most situations (that do not involve any kind of legal or privacy issues) would still be under user responsibility.</p> <!-- VALUES -->

						<hr>

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Brainstorm three value tensions that your system may engage.  For each value tension, identify one or more design features that favors one of the values over the other.&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our project certainly puts us in a conundrum when making decisions during hard situations. We must weigh the options of privacy over the ability to find decent matches. The more we can know about the user, the better our chances are of evaluating their likes and dislikes. However, this will not stop our program from functioning in the long run. Another thing we have to consider is how to promote a fun atmosphere, while not removing the inherent competitive atmosphere that appears within games. The best way to solve this, in our opinion, is to give the user and option of playing either a ranked or social game to  determine where it will sit on the competitive spectrum. This, however, lead to the question of user generated content and our structures. We have decided to firmly stand behind our users when it comes to information gathering, as our applications as a whole is mainly fueled by our users.</p> <!-- VALUES -->

						<hr>

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Generate a list of as many potentially implicated values as possible in five minutes (your list may contain some or none of the values suggested here).  Then, briefly discuss each of the values on your list.&rdquo;</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this question, we wrote down calmness, community, inclusivity, and autonomy. We believe that our application will definitely generate and support a sense of calmness, community, and inclusivity. The entire purpose for our app is to bring people together to have fun, therefore we are striving to provide a safe way for others to communicate with each other. Another important aspect of Gathering the Magik&trade; is the autonomous functionality; the ability for a user to create a game for others to join, and then carrying on with their daily business while they wait.</p> <!-- VALUES -->

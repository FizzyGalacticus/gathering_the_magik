			<p>	We introduce a set of four criteria – stakeholders, time, values, and pervasiveness – intended to provide perspective and focus for considering the long-term systemic effects of current and future technologies. The time and pervasiveness criteria provide a future-oriented perspective. The stakeholders and values criteria focus on ethical considerations. Used in combination, we posit that the criteria go a good distance toward articulating what a value sensitive envisioning process might entail when considering functionality requirements, compatibility issues, and contexts of use in terms of systemic effects on persons and society.

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Envision your system in use by a single stakeholder. Now imagine 100 such individuals interacting with the system. Then 1,000 individuals. Then 100,000. What new interactions might emerge from widespread use? Find three synergistic benefits of widespread use and three potential breakdowns.&rdquo;</blockquote>    For this particular issue, we looked at a similar situation, Facebook, where this might be the case. Facebook was created originally as a forum-type website solely for Harvard University students. Now, it is used by over 1.5 billion people worldwide (Expandedramblings). We believe that our application, although being made solely to target a specific group of people, might contain functionality that others would be interested in using as a type of social media. Features like having profiles, friends, being matched with others according to personal preferences, etc are all things that you see on Facebook today. With this in mind, the possibility exists that, after a while, the underlying infrastructure and security of our application would need to be expanded to accommodate the public demand.</p> <!-- PERVASIVENESS -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Enumerate 2-3 diverse geographies.  For each geographic setting, consider ways in which the system could be adapted to better fit that environment.&rdquo;</blockquote>    This is something that had not quite come to our thoughts until it was brought up. With our application relying on the community to work together to meet up and play games this could make it difficult for small and spread out groups of people to really benefit from the program. Since Gathering the Magik can be used on all sorts of events they could choose to meet online, or perhaps for some outdoor activity. There also could be locations set up between towns, or local shops that deal in games  or reserve space for activities. </p> <!-- PERVASIVENESS -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Characterize two different political environments in which your system is likely to be deployed.  Consider how those political realities may influence how individuals in those environments may interact with the features of your system.&rdquo;</blockquote>    This was one of the most difficult cards to answer. At first, our group was very confused about what the card was asking. Then we began to think about other countries in which certain or specific social gatherings were regulated or not even permitted. We believe that humans as a whole share a fondness for games in general, without any specifics. This means that our application could potentially disrupt current government or political policies currently suppressing game players around the world. An example would be North Korea, where social media, internet, etc are all regulated and censored. If our application were to become popular enough, it might cause some disturbance in their current governmental system.</p> <!-- PERVASIVENESS -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Identify three roles that involve non-intended use of the system.&rdquo;</blockquote>    Our initial thoughts after reading this moved to how many other possible types of events it could pull people together for. However after a minute we realized there was another side we have to really consider especially when the card asks for unintended uses. First, we considered some things such as  political rallies, a meeting of people, but not to play games or do fun activities. The next thought was how advertisements could be thrown up there, there may be adds with the service but not fake games to serve as advertisements for free. Finally, worst case, that this acts as an easier way to set up abductions. Since the app works to facilitate people meeting up, even though they do not know each other there, this is where that danger arises.</p> <!-- STAKEHOLDERS -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Generate a list of 3-5 indirect stakeholders. For each indirect stakeholder role, note at least one concern specific to that role. You may refer back to these roles throughout the project.&rdquo;</blockquote>    This card made us think about some issues that were not straight-forward or apparent. The largest indirect stakeholder in our opinion are the parents of minors using our application. The biggest concern here is that our application could potentially be used by a predator for illegal activities. The second indirect stakeholder we listed was local business. We are concerned that our application could potentially cause an influx in loitering within the premises of local business, potentially disturbing their everyday business. Finally, we listed game makers/developers as an indirect stakeholder. Our application could be a means to either make or break a particular game, and can even raise or lower the demand for those games.</p> <!-- STAKEHOLDERS -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Create a list of the system's direct stakeholders.  For each stakeholder role, note at least one concern specific to that role.  You may refer back to these roles throughout the project.&rdquo;</blockquote>    This made us take time to consider who is interested in the success of our business. Each stakeholder may have a concern that stems from the development of the product, such as small specialty shops worrying about what they need to stock. Event and public meeting areas may have an influx in use, which would require more maintenance and upkeep. Finally, game manufacturers are going to possibly see a change in their business, for better or worse. They may even display opposition toward our application.</p> <!-- STAKEHOLDERS -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Design a scenario of your product changing hands.  Imagine a specific challenge an individual might face when wanting to shift ownership.  What features might make this process smoother?&rdquo;</blockquote>    This brought up a scenario that we had not previously considered, since the idea would only be important in specific instances. The best example we came up with would be if some event needed to change hands from one user to another. This situation could arise if the current owner of the event or game felt that another user would do a better job managing the event, and wants to pass ownership.</p> <!-- STAKEHOLDERS -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Invent a future storyline in which the system you are developing is no longer supported.  Consider how obsolescence affects normal use of the system, and how problems with the system may be resolved.&rdquo;</blockquote>    This made us seriously consider evaluating the possibilities of our application losing the support of our communities. Because it is a simple idea as long as the program itself fails to be ported to newer technologies it realies solely on the involvement of the user since they are interacting with each other and this simply acts as a facilitator between them.</p> <!-- TIME -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Imagine five years out from now and consider 3-5 ways the system might influence friendships and family relationships.&rdquo;</blockquote>    We thought about the possible effects of our application on stakeholders, and there were a few things that stood out. The most common, almost stereotypical, thought about any game or gamer is the addictive properties. We want to provide our users with the best experience possible, and maintain credibility while doing so. Game addiction is certainly not unheard of, and is definitely one of our primary concerns. Another, brighter prospect we considered is of our application bringing people together and potentially laying the foundation for new friendships and even families. We acknowledge that some of our users may not be the most socially aware, and we hope to close the gap with our application.</p> <!-- TIME -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Picture your system in use many years from now.  Identify three ways in which an individual's intentional non-use of the system might affect that person's daily life or the system as a whole.&rdquo;</blockquote>    Looking at the possibility of people not using our application was not particularly difficult. It should not become a very prolific thing in people's lives. It will help them arrange games between themselves and others, however there will still be ways for people to communicate outside the application. The goal is not to phase out other means of people communicating, so at worst the intentional non-use of the system would cause a person to have additional difficulties finding members of their game community to play with.</p> <!-- TIME -->

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Deliberate on and then designate three primary values the system ideally would support.&rdquo;</blockquote>    Considering what sort of values might be cultivated by being a user of our application allows us to see some of the possible benefits. Gathering the Magik as a system tries to promote personal interaction, diversity, and healthy competition. People get together to play games in a day and age where digital interaction is growing in popularity. The diversity comes through the exploration of new games and meeting new people to interact with. Finally, a healthy competitive atmosphere is important. We want people to be invested in their games while not getting worked up about it, that way it stays an enjoyable experience for a variety of people.</p> <!-- VALUES -->

						<hr>

						<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Ask potential users whether use of the system has any positive or negative effects on a value that they feel is important.  You might ask whether a specific feature of the system is OK and why (e.g., A camera is pointed at a fountain in a public plaza.  The live images of people in the plaza are being displayed in someone's office.  Is it OK or not OK that the image is displayed in the office if the people in the plaza are unaware of it?  Why or why not?).&rdquo;</blockquote>    This card was met with very positive feedback. Our group decided unanimously that our application’s sole purpose is to bring people with common gaming interests together. Therefore, any issues between users could be avoided simply by not joining games with known problematic users. Should any issues escalate further, then we would handle those on a case by case basis, but most situations (that do not involve any kind of legal or privacy issues) would still be under user responsibility.</p> <!-- VALUES -->

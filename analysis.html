				<p>	Our group decided to conceptualize an application that allows gamers of all forms find others with similar game interests. This can range from old school pen-and-paper games to video games. Our application would take statistics from each user and use them to find viable matches and even allow them to play games with each other, whether it be on a digital device or in person.</p>

				<p>	Going into this stage, we each had to come up with an idea for an application or system that we wished to be a part of designing. However the only control over that idea we had was the initial thought. All of our classmates quickly expanded upon each idea, pushing them toward new and exciting directions. Many different ways at approaching the problem or idea meant that the whole idea could evolve into something greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

				<p>	The rapid generation of ideas was very helpful when attempting to flesh out our base idea. This resulted with each of us steering the project the way we think it should go. Not all group members had the same initial thoughts on this. While one group member was considering all the needs of the user, another was thinking about how it could interact with local businesses.</p>

				<p>During this phase, our group posted all of the post-it notes to the whiteboard and silently moved them into specific categories based off of their functions. After approximately ten minutes, we were allowed to talk with one-another and determine if the right choices were made, or to make adjustments as necessary. These were our results: </p>

				<p>	With the creation of the Bullâ€™s-eye Diagram, we were able to get a better idea of what kind of groups would be affected by the usage of our app. From greatest to least, we grouped them into specific categories. While we knew that our innermost group would be composed of gamers in general, there was some confusion on what it means to be a direct or indirect stakeholder. After some deliberation, we were able to come out with a clear idea of what types of audiences fall into each group.</p>

				<p>	The forced ranking process allowed our group to prioritize features that would push our product in the direction we would like and not just sit on a smattering of concepts. It also assisted with weeding out ideas that were either ill thought or did not fit in our vision. Some ideas, although good, were too separated from our base application to be compatible with the rest the project.</p>
